        + Add : The new ->callbacks method to the regexp object let you specify
                the 'exec' callback on an individual basis.
        + Chg : Perl 5.10 is now required (instead of 5.9.5).
        + Fix : The pragma was leaking into required scopes on 5.10.0.
        + Fix : If you specified a different re::engine::Plugin between the
                compilation and the execution of a regular expression, the
                'exec' callback invoked used to be the one for the second
                engine. Worse, if the original engine wasn't in scope at the
                time of execution, nothing happened. This is now fixed.
        + Fix : The reference count of the callbacks stored wasn't properly
                decremented.
        + Fix : Incomplete MANIFEST.
        + Tst : Subdirectories are now ordered.
        + Tst : Author tests.

        + Fix : [perl #38684]: test failures in t/method/mod.t
